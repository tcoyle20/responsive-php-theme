Lightweight, Responsive PHP Theme for Web Developers
=================

Built with PHP, Foundation 4, Sass+Compass, as well as other tools you would expect.

There's also a sample MySQL DB Class, Password Salter and config file.

I made this system to help me quickly knock off small projects where a CMS or framework would be too much.
